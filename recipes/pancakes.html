        <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl mix the <em>flour</em> with the <em>baking powder</em> and <em>salt.</em></li>
        <li>In a bigger bowl beat <em>eggs</em> with <em>sugar.</em></li>
        <li>Into the bigger bowl add <em>oil</em> and <em>milk</em> and stir (whisk/blend/mix) until the foam appears.</li>
        <li>Add dry ingredients to the wet ones and mix quickly (for not too long, because it makes pancakes hard).</li>
